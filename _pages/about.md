Hi y'all! üòÜü§ìü§ñ

I'm Aria and this is my digital portfolio. It will cover most of my experience, especially those relavent to Robotics, including past and ongoing research, projects, and internships. 

Quick intro about myself. I'm currently an undergrad majoring in Mechanical Engineering with a concentration on Robotics at Northwestern University. My passion lies at the intersection of Control Systems, Robot Learning, and Hardware Design. My skills bridge both hardware and software domains. My focus at this point on multi-agent localization and exploring reinforcement learning applications in autonomous vehicles. Moving forward, I'm looking into opportunities in control software and system integration in related fields. 

Looking forward to connecting and sharing ideas! 

<!--
